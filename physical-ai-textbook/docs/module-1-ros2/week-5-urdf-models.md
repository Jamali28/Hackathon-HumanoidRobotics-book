# Module 1: ROS 2 - Week 5: URDF Humanoid Models

This week introduces the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) for modeling robot kinematics and visual properties, with a focus on humanoid robots.

## Learning Objectives

*   Understand URDF syntax and structure.
*   Create simple URDF models for humanoid robot components.
*   Visualize URDF models in RViz.

## Lab Exercises

*   **Lab 5.1**: Build a basic URDF model of a robot arm.
*   **Lab 5.2**: Add visual and collision properties to a URDF model.
