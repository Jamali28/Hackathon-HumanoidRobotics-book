# Robot Lab Options: Proxy, Miniature, and Premium Humanoids

This document outlines various robot lab options available for practical experimentation, catering to different budgets and learning objectives. Each option provides a unique platform for applying physical AI and humanoid robotics concepts.

## 1. Proxy Robot Option: Unitree Go2 Edu

*   **Description**: A quadruped robot offering dynamic locomotion and a robust platform for ROS 2 integration, suitable for exploring mobile robotics and basic manipulation.
*   **Pros**: Relatively affordable, good community support, open-source ROS packages.
*   **Cons**: Not a humanoid, limited manipulation capabilities compared to bipedal robots.

## 2. Miniature Humanoid Option: Unitree G1 / Robotis OP3 / Hiwonder TonyPi

*   **Description**: Small-scale bipedal robots designed for education and research, allowing for experimentation with humanoid kinematics, balance, and simple gestures.
*   **Pros**: True humanoid form factor, good for bipedal locomotion studies, often comes with example code.
*   **Cons**: Limited payload, complex to program for advanced tasks.

## 3. Premium Humanoid Option: Unitree G1

*   **Description**: A more advanced humanoid robot offering sophisticated control, higher degrees of freedom, and greater payload capacity, ideal for complex manipulation, human-robot interaction, and advanced AI research.
*   **Pros**: High performance, advanced capabilities, robust hardware.
*   **Cons**: Significantly higher cost, steeper learning curve.

## Considerations for Choosing a Robot

*   **Budget**: Evaluate the cost of the robot and maintenance.
*   **Learning Objectives**: Match the robot's capabilities to your course goals.
*   **Complexity**: Consider the programming complexity and available support.
*   **Availability**: Check lead times and accessibility.
