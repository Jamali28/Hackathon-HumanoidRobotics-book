# Module 2: Digital Twin - Physics Simulation, URDF/SDF Imports, Collisions, and Sensors

This section dives into the technical details of building and interacting with digital twins in simulation environments. We will cover physics engines, importing robot models, collision detection, and simulating various sensors.

## Topics Covered

*   Physics Engines in Simulation (e.g., ODE, PhysX)
*   Importing URDF and SDF Models
*   Configuring Collision Geometries
*   Simulating Sensors (LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs)
*   Interacting with the Simulation Environment
