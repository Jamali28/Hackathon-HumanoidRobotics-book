# Module 2: Digital Twin - Week 7: Advanced Simulation and Unity Visualization

This week focuses on advanced Gazebo features like physics tuning and sensor simulation, and introduces Unity for high-fidelity robot visualization.

## Learning Objectives

*   Configure physics parameters in Gazebo.
*   Implement various sensor simulations (LiDAR, cameras).
*   Explore Unity as a visualization tool for humanoid robots.

## Lab Exercises

*   **Lab 7.1**: Simulate a LiDAR sensor in Gazebo and visualize its output.
*   **Lab 7.2**: Connect a ROS 2 topic to Unity for real-time robot state visualization.
