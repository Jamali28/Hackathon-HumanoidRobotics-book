# Module 2: Digital Twin - Week 6: Gazebo Simulation Basics

This week covers the fundamentals of Gazebo, a powerful 3D robot simulator, and how to integrate ROS 2 with it to create digital twins.

## Learning Objectives

*   Launch and interact with Gazebo simulations.
*   Understand SDF models and their role in Gazebo.
*   Integrate basic ROS 2 communication with Gazebo.

## Lab Exercises

*   **Lab 6.1**: Launch a pre-built Gazebo world and control a simple robot.
*   **Lab 6.2**: Import a simple URDF model into Gazebo.
