# Module 3: AI-Robot Brain - Week 9: Advanced Perception and Object Interaction

This week deepens our understanding of perception, covering object detection, segmentation, and how robots can interact with detected objects in simulation.

## Learning Objectives

*   Implement advanced object detection and segmentation.
*   Understand sensor fusion techniques.
*   Enable robots to interact with objects based on perception.

## Lab Exercises

*   **Lab 9.1**: Develop an object detection pipeline for a specific object.
*   **Lab 9.2**: Program a robot to grasp a detected object in Isaac Sim.
