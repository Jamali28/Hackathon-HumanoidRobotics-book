# ROS 2 Package Development Project Assessment

This assessment evaluates your ability to develop and integrate ROS 2 packages using Python, focusing on nodes, topics, and services.

## Instructions

1.  **Develop a ROS 2 Package**: Create a new ROS 2 package that includes at least two Python nodes, one publisher, one subscriber, and a service client/server pair.
2.  **Functionality**: The package should demonstrate a clear use case (e.g., a simple robot control system, data processing pipeline).
3.  **Testing**: Include unit tests for your nodes and services using `pytest` and `ros2-easy-test`.
4.  **Documentation**: Provide a `README.md` within your package explaining its functionality and how to run it.

|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Package Structure** | Incomplete or incorrect.           | Basic structure, some issues.          | Correct and logical.                     | Exemplary, follows best practices.        |
| **Node Implementation** | Functional issues.               | Basic functionality, minor bugs.       | Fully functional, clear code.            | Robust, efficient, well-documented.       |
| **Communication**     | Errors in topics/services.         | Basic topics/services, some errors.    | Correctly implements topics/services.    | Advanced, reliable communication.         |
| **Testing**           | No tests or failing tests.         | Basic tests, limited coverage.         | Good test coverage, passes.              | Comprehensive, robust test suite.         |
| **Documentation**     | Missing or unclear.                | Basic explanation.                     | Clear and concise.                       | Detailed, easy to understand.             |
