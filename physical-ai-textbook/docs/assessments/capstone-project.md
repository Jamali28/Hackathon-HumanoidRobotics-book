# Capstone Project Assessment: Simulated Humanoid Robot with Conversational AI

This capstone project integrates all concepts learned in the course, demonstrating an autonomous humanoid robot controlled by voice commands and cognitive planning, interacting with a simulated environment.

## Instructions

1.  **Full VLA Pipeline**: Implement the entire Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipeline:
    *   **Voice Command**: Receive and interpret voice commands.
    *   **Cognitive Planning**: Translate voice commands into a sequence of robot actions.
    *   **Navigation**: Navigate the robot in a simulated environment.
    *   **Perception**: Use sensors to perceive and interact with objects.
    *   **Manipulation**: Perform physical manipulation tasks (e.g., grasping, placing).
2.  **Humanoid Robot**: Utilize a simulated humanoid robot model.
3.  **Demonstration**: Provide a live demonstration of the robot performing a complex task based on voice commands.
4.  **Presentation**: Present your project, explaining the architecture, implementation details, challenges, and results.
