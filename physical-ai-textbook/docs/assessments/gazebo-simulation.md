# Gazebo Simulation Implementation Assessment

This assessment evaluates your ability to create and interact with robot simulations in Gazebo, integrating ROS 2 for control and sensor data processing.

## Instructions

1.  **Gazebo World**: Create a custom Gazebo world that includes obstacles and target objects.
2.  **Robot Model**: Integrate a URDF/SDF robot model into your Gazebo world.
3.  **Sensor Simulation**: Simulate at least two types of sensors (e.g., LiDAR, camera, IMU) on your robot model.
4.  **ROS 2 Control**: Develop ROS 2 nodes to control the robot within the Gazebo simulation and process sensor data.
5.  **Task Implementation**: Program the robot to perform a specific task in the simulated environment (e.g., navigate to a point, avoid obstacles, pick up an object).
