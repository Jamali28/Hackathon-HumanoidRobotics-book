# Isaac Perception Pipeline Assessment

This assessment evaluates your ability to implement and utilize perception pipelines within the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem, focusing on VSLAM and object detection.

## Instructions

1.  **Isaac Sim Setup**: Create an Isaac Sim environment with a robot and various objects.
2.  **VSLAM Implementation**: Implement a VSLAM pipeline using Isaac ROS to localize the robot within the environment.
3.  **Object Detection**: Develop a perception pipeline to detect and classify specific objects in the Isaac Sim environment.
4.  **Data Visualization**: Visualize the VSLAM output (e.g., pose, map) and object detection results.
5.  **Integration**: Demonstrate how the perception data can be used to inform robot actions (e.g., navigating to a detected object).
