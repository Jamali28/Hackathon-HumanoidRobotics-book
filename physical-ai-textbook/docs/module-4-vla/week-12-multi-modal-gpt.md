# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Week 12: Multi-modal Integration and GPT

This week explores advanced multi-modal integration, combining various sensor inputs with large language models like GPT to enable more sophisticated robot understanding and interaction.

## Learning Objectives

*   Integrate multiple sensor modalities (vision, audio).
*   Understand how GPT can enhance robot intelligence.
*   Develop multi-modal interaction strategies.

## Lab Exercises

*   **Lab 12.1**: Implement a system that responds to visual and auditory cues.
*   **Lab 12.2**: Experiment with GPT integration for contextual robot responses.
