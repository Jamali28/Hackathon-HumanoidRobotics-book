# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Week 11: Voice-to-Action and Cognitive Planning

This week introduces the core concepts of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, focusing on how voice commands are translated into robot actions through cognitive planning.

## Learning Objectives

*   Understand the VLA paradigm.
*   Implement voice command recognition.
*   Explore cognitive planning frameworks for robots.

## Lab Exercises

*   **Lab 11.1**: Integrate a speech-to-text service with a simple robot command interface.
*   **Lab 11.2**: Design a basic planning system to convert high-level commands to low-level actions.
