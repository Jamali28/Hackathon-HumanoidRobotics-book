# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Multi-modal Content (Combining Sensors, Vision, and GPT Integration)

This section explores multi-modal integration within VLA systems, where robots combine information from various sensors (vision, audio, touch), process it using advanced AI models (e.g., GPT), and use this comprehensive understanding to inform their actions.

## Topics Covered

*   Multi-modal Sensor Integration
*   Vision Systems for Humanoid Robots
*   Integrating GPT with Robotic Systems
*   Contextual Understanding and Reasoning
*   Case Studies in Multi-modal Robotics
