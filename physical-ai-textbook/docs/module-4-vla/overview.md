# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Overview

This module introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, focusing on how robots can understand voice commands, plan complex actions, and execute them in physical and digital environments. We will cover the integration of voice recognition, cognitive planning, and robot control.

## Topics Covered

*   Introduction to VLA Systems
*   Voice-to-Action (e.g., using OpenAI Whisper)
*   Cognitive Planning for Robots (LLM → ROS 2 actions)
*   Architecture of a VLA System
*   Challenges and Future Directions
