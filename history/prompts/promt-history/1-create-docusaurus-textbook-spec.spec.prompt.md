  Build a Docusaurus-based textbook for the full Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum. Content must strictly follow the provided course details, modules, weekly breakdowns, learning outcomes, and hardware requirements. All output must be structured, chunkable, and RAG-ready without inventing or altering information.

Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Module 3: AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Weekly Breakdown (Weeks 1–13) - Assessments - Hardware Requirements & Lab Architecture - Why Physical AI Matters ", // CONTENT RULES "All content must originate from user-provided course material only.", "No external facts, assumptions, or additional interpretations.", "All chapters must follow a consistent Docusaurus Markdown template.", "Headings, lists, callouts, and tables must remain Docusaurus-compatible.", "Content must be chunkable for stable RAG semantics.", "Each chapter must include Docusaurus frontmatter metadata.", // TECHNICAL & RAG INTEGRATION "Modules, weeks, and hardware sections must be independently indexable.", "Chapters must support deterministic RAG retrieval from provided content.", "Chatbot integrations must rely on stable IDs, headings, and paths.", // DEPLOYMENT "The book must build and deploy on GitHub Pages without modification.", "Markdown and assets must be compatible with Docusaurus and GitHub Pages.", "Directory paths must remain PowerShell-friendly." ] // --------------------------- // NONFUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS // --------------------------- nonfunctional_requirements: [ "Consistent formatting, terminology, and structure across the book.", "Clarity suitable for learners in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.", "Strict source-grounding with no hallucinations.", "Reproducible build workflow using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code.", "Predictable navigation for readers and RAG pipelines." ] // --------------------------- // CHAPTER STRUCTURE TEMPLATE // --------------------------- chapter_structure_template: """ --- id: <unique_id> title: <chapter_title> description: <short_summary> keywords: [physical-ai, humanoid-robotics, ros2, isaac, vla] --- # <Chapter Title> ## Overview (High-level summary) ## Core Concepts (Bullet points or subsections from provided material) ## Technical Details (Tables, diagrams, structured lists from source content) ## Examples / Use Cases (Only if provided) ## Summary (Concise restatement, no new facts) """ // --------------------------- // TEXTBOOK CONTENT REQUIREMENTS // --------------------------- textbook_content_requirements: [ // INTRODUCTION "Introduction must cover: -
